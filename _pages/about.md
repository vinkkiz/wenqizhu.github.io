I am a first-year PhD student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) (KCL), working with [Dr Timothy Neate](https://tdjneate.github.io/) and funded by [EPSRC DRIVE-Health CDT](https://www.drive-health.org.uk/).

I work at the intersection of **HCI, accessibility, and healthcare**, aiming to create technologies that empower marginalised populations such as people with communication difficulties.

Before starting my PhD, I earned my MSc in Human-Computer Interaction from [UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic/), and my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science (Human-Computer Interaction) from [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

I am also a photography lover. I see my eyes as a camera’s viewfinder, always attuned to the fleeting moments of beauty in everyday life. You can find some of my photographic work [here](https://www.instagram.com/vinkkiz.photo/) 📷
